              <h3>About Us</h3>
              <p>Hangover Factory is a punk rock band composed of four dudes who live in Minneapolis, MN. 
              The project started circa 2017 with songs that just about anyone would describe as basic 
              pop punk, but the sound  changed over time as the members became more and more frustrated 
              by things occurring in society. Basically, it was increasingly difficult to sing catchy 
              tunes about the banality of inter personal relationships while cops were literally slaying 
              our neighbors and getting away with it. So the song writing started to focus on more 
              important things. If you're into that... Cool. You may like what we do.</p>
